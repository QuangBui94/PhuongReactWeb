                    <p className="col-12">In 2016, I was working as a freelance videographer, I came across a UX course online and I love it. 
                    From there, it had become my one and only passion. I started developing a taste for pixel perfect design and how to make an idea possible in this digital world by desiging and iterating.</p>

However, it is not enough, being a designer mean you have to be able to communicate with everyone in the team and understand their characteristic as well as their field of knowledge. Thus, I spend a majority of my time trying to build a meaningful relationship with others and improve my communication skill to have them working with me as a partner, side by side and together.</p>

Therefore, I want to share that lesson to everyone as well as giving my knowledge to those who canâ€™t afford and are struggling in their design journey. I made a Youtube channel to talk about design problem and how people can learn to become a designer. I would wake up early in the morning and write something to share for my audience. Maybe you can also benefit from what I share. Have a look down here. </p>
